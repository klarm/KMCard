# Introduction
**RVCard** is a lightweight, high-performance solution for creating dynamic UI components. It supports building reusable UI components by writing XML layouts, and you can also build flexible combinations of them. There are various forms of embedding RVCard in your existing code. See the **Demo** and **How to Start** for more details.

# How to Use
There are three ways to use RVCard in your project:
- Use it as a whole page
	- step 0: Add RVCardView to your page
	- step 1: Set page data for RVCardView
	- step 2: Call reload of RVCardView

- Use it as an independent UI component or a combination of them
	- step 0: Call buildRVView of RVSkinParser when you use it as an independent UI component
	- step 1: Call buildAssembledRVSkins of RVSkinAssembler when you use it as a combination of UI components
	- step 2: Then the method above returns a common view, use it as usual

- Use it for structured non-standard data
	- step 0: Implement four delegates
	- step 1: Implement a data binder method 
	- step 2: Register the above binder for a certain layout
